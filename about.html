        <ul class="about-list">
            <li>I was born and raised in Siberia, so I am adapted to the range of temperatures from -40°C to +35°C.</li>
            
            <li>I was a pitcher on CERGE-EI "Invisible Hands" softball team. During my studies, we never made it even to the semi-finals.</li>
            
            <li>I enjoy climbing and mountaineering. I was on expeditions in the Alps, Tatra, Pamir-Alay, Tian Shan, Sayan, and the Caucasus mountains. Approximately a quarter of my ascents were not successful.</li>
            
            <li>In 2008–2013, I played in a classical guitar orchestra and performed in student theater. Later, I did not pass the entrance exams at the Theater Institute.</li>
            
            <li>In 2011–2012, I worked as an interpreter for the nonprofit environmental organization <a href="https://en.greatbaikaltrail.org/" target="_blank">"The Great Baikal Trail"</a>. The GBT builds hiking trails around Lake Baikal (if you have time and like eco-tourism seriously consider experiencing it). I worked on a project exploring the route in Dzherginsky Nature Reserve and on another one that sought to relocate the old watermill from the forest to the Lake Baikal shore.</li>
            
            <li>In 2008–2013, I had several internships in various public nonprofit organizations. I was also a volunteer and worked with kids. This experience included being a clown and teaching animation, among other things.</li>
            
            <li>In 2011, I was invited to the University MMA team. I also played tennis for a year, but now I have no idea how to do it. I play volleyball and basketball though.</li>
