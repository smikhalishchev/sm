                We study a model with rationally inattentive voters and investigate how an office-seeking challenger designs a policy platform in the presence of the incumbent who offers a simple stability-providing policy that preserves the status quo. We show that the incumbent's simple policy, while not in the best interest of the electorate, creates negative externalities by encouraging the challenger to propose a more moderate platform, which is sub-optimal for the voter. The model also explains why and when the incumbent benefits from the high uncertainty and intermediate cost of information.

            <div class="abstract">
                A candidate can spend time either on improving his fit with a firm or on disclosing his initial type. The HR manager performs a costly test and decides whether to hire the candidate. We characterize when the disclosure and effort equilibria exist. In industries where it is difficult to screen candidates, only the disclosure equilibrium exists. In addition, we demonstrate that high wages lead to the effort equilibrium in lemon-dropping markets but to the disclosure equilibrium in cherry-picking markets. Finally, we show that whenever both equilibria exist, the candidates and the social planner prefer the effort equilibrium, and, surprisingly, the HR manager might prefer the disclosure equilibrium. We show that enforcing any hiring quota could shut off the effort equilibrium.

                This paper studies the information choice of exchange-traded funds (ETF) investors, and its impact on the price efficiency of underlying stocks. First, we show that the learning of stock-specific information happens at the ETF level. Furthermore, our results suggest that ETF investors endogenously respond to changes in the fundamental value of underlying stocks in line with the rational inattention theory. Second, we provide evidence that ETFs facilitate the propagation of idiosyncratic shocks across their constituents.

            <div class="abstract">
                This paper introduces a new role of quotas, e.g. labor market quotas: the attentional role. We study the effect of quota implementation on the attention allocation strategy of a rationally inattentive (RI) agent. Our main result is that an RI agent who is forced to fulfill a quota never hires the candidates without acquiring information about them, unlike an unrestricted RI agent who in some cases bases her decision on prior belief only. We also find that in our context quotas are equivalent to other types of affirmative policies such as subsidies and blind resume policy. We show how our results can be used to set a quota level that increases the expected value of the chosen candidate, corrects for inaccurate beliefs and induces truthful type revelation by candidates.

                This paper studies how an optimal menu chosen by a social planner depends on whether agents receive imperfect signals about their true tastes (imperfect self-knowledge) or the properties of available alternatives (imperfect information). Under imperfect self-knowledge, it is not optimal to offer fewer alternatives than the number of different tastes present in the population, unless noise is infinite (agents have no clue about their true preferences). As noise increases, the social planner offers menu items that are closer together (more similar). However, under imperfect information, as noise increases, it could be optimal to construct a menu with more distinct alternatives, restrict the number of options, or, for some finite noise, offer a single item.
